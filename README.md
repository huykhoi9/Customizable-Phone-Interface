# Customizable-Phone-Interface Capstone Project
This is my Capstone Project. I'm responsible for building a heart rate monitor and hardware device for CPI that can be controlled by a button to make phone calls for people who are physically challenged from a wide array of disabilities (old age, Parkinsonâ€™s, MS, Paralysis, etc.).
