# Customizable-Phone-Interface Capstone Project
This is my Capstone Project. I'm responsible for building a heart rate monitor and hardware device for CPI that can be controlled by a button to make phone calls for people who are physically challenged from a wide array of disabilities (old age, Parkinsonâ€™s, MS, Paralysis, etc.).

## Pulse Oximeter heart rate monitor
I wrote the code to detect the peaks of the signal, calculate the heartbeat and plotted it in a GUI
Several libraries were used such as numpy, matplotlib, serial, and scipy in Python.

## 3D design CPI enclosure (SOLIDWORKS)
3D-designed the enclosure of the CPI that perfectly fits the dimensions of the raspberry Pi. One feature of this enclosure is that I can stack up many layers I want on top of it which is neater than the previous design. All the cables and wires will be on one designated layer and LCD display will be on a final layer. The CPI is 3 cm tall, which is a perfect size for a small device.
